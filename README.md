# Phaser 3 API Documentation

The official Phaser API Documentation can be found at [https://newdocs.phaser.io](https://newdocs.phaser.io)

This repository contains a few utility files, such as JSON/JSDoc to SQL conversion scripts, that we use. But the actual docs themselves should be accessed from the URL above.
